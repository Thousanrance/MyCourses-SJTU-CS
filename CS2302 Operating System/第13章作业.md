答：

a. 

方法一：Create an access control list with the names of these 4990 users.

方法二：Put these 4990 users in one group and set the group access accordingly. 

b. 

The universe access information applies to all users unless their name appears in the access control list with different access permission. So we can simply put the names of the remaining ten users in the access control list with no access privileges allowed.
